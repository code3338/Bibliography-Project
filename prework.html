             Hi, My name is <b>Melissa Coppola</b>. I was born in Columbia, MO. I have 5 brothers and two sisters. Of the 5 brothers, 
             one of them is my twin brother. July 4th, 2015 I married a man that I am so blessed to have in my life. 

             I served in the United States Army Reserves for 9 years. While serving I completed my Associate of Arts
             degree in 2012, and then went on to complete my Bachelors of Health Science with a minor in Business from the
             University of Missouri - Columbia in 2016. After graduation, I worked as an Acute Case Management Consultant
             for Cerner Corporation where I traveled to client sites. While on site, I assisted clientsin building and 
             customizing Acute Case Management solutions geared to client preferences using Cerner's electronic build tool 
             programs. Currently, my goal is to work in web development, as I enjoy analyzing problems and solving them.

             Regardless of my achievements, my greatest decision to date, is my decision to accept Jesus Christ as Lord 
             and Savior of my life. I choose to serve Him faithfully. Though, I am far from perfect, I know my Heavenly
             Father,in the name of Jesus Christ, continues to help me grow, and to be better than I ever could be on my 
             own.

        <h4>Verse/Quote</h4>
        <p>This is a one of my favorite verses from the Holy Bible in <i>1 Corinthians 13:4-8</i>.<blockquote><strong>Love</strong> is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant, or rude. 
           It is not self-seeking; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.</blockquote></p>
